Matlab codes for the earth deformation model in [Bueler, Lingle, Brown (2007),
_Fast computation of a viscoelastic deformable Earth model for ice-sheet
simulations_, Annals of Glaciology 46, 97-105](https://doi.org/10.3189/172756407782871567).

These codes were recovered from the source files for the [arxiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0606074)
which preceded the published paper.

### Matlab codes

**Work in progress**  The codes in `matlab/` do not work in current Octave.
Feel free to send me updated codes which do.  Perhaps first try to run the
examples which appear from
